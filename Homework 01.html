  <h1> Homework#1 </h1>
  <h2>My favorite movie：<em>Animal World</em></h2>
  <ul>
    <li><h3>What is the movie about?</h3></li>
    
      <p>The protagonist,<strong> Zheng</strong>, is a clown who works in a game hall. His mother is seriously ill and in need of money for treatment immediately.<br> To raise money, he sold his house with the help of his friends called <strong>Shrimp</strong>, but <strong>Shrimp</strong> set a <strong>trap</strong> when he signed the contract,<br> cheated him of his money and made him sign a huge debt. Later,<strong> a mysterious man</strong> who claims to be a creditor, appears and invites<br> the Zheng to board the ship for a <strong>gambling</strong> game. If he wins, he has the chance to pay off his debts and get a lot of money. If he loses, he will stay on the ship. The <strong>Zheng</strong> boards the ship and meets <strong>Shrimp</strong> again. They find that the loser<br> will be caught doing <br><strong>human experiments</strong>. After experiencing deception and cheating among players, <strong>Zheng</strong> defeats other players, gains the opportunity to leave and<br> earns a lot of money.

    <li><h3> Why do you like the film? </h3></li>
      <ol>
      <li><p>The film is adapted from Japanese manga, but it does not completely copy the content of the manga, simplifies the relationship between<br> the characters and reduces the difficulty of the game, so that the audience can understand the whole story in 130 minutes.</p></li>
      
      <li><p>There's only one game: Rock-Scissors-Paper, but it's more difficult and interesting through multi-player and card games. I like this game <br>very much, and I also like the feeling of analyzing with the movie.</p></li>
      
      <li><p>The special effects of racing are cool and the fighting scenes are wonderful.</p></li>
        
      <li><p>The choice between life and death, under the temptation of interests, is depicted very real. It transformed ships into a world of jungle.</p></li>
        
      <li><p>After betrayal and deception, the protagonist did not become an animal like others. As he said: <blockquote><em>“I'd rather be a life-long clown, and never be a jerk like you”.</em></blockquote>
      </ol>
    
   
    <li><h3>Why should people see this film?</h3></li>
      <ol>
        <li><p>The special effects and fighting scenes are cool.<p></li>
        <li><p>The game in the movie is very interesting, and the difficulty is just right. It's easy for the audience to think about it. It's also <br>exciting to bet on life and death.</p></li>
        <li><p>The strategies used in the characterization of human nature and game play are reasonable. There are basically no big problems in the film.</p></li>
